When you contract your leg muscles during exercise, muscles squeeze veins near them to pump blood toward the heart. Then when leg muscles relax, the veins fill up with blood. The pumping action of leg muscles during exercise forces extra blood to the heart, which causes the heat to beat faster and contract stronger.|I agree because that page contained info about heart rate which is what Alice was looking for.|3

Echo Dogs White Shepherd Rescue is a foster home based organization. We do not operate a shelter. The temperament and behavior of each dog is carefully evaluated while they are in foster care so that we can match each dog with a home best suited to meet their particular needs.

Before the American purchase of the territory in 1803, the current Louisiana State had been both a French colony and for a brief period, a Spanish one. In addition, colonists imported numerous African slaves as laborers in the 18th century. Many came from peoples of the same region of West Africa, thus concentrating their culture. In the post-Civil War environment, Anglo-Americans increased the pressure for Anglicization, and in 1921, English was made the only official language of the state.[8] Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four that have not yet received recognition.[9]|The webpage has information about Louisiana only.|2

In the early 20th century the Alexian Brothers had four hospitals in the United States. The first was built in Chicago in 1866; it was destroyed by the Great Fire, on 9 October 1871, and rebuilt the following year. The second, erected at St. Louis in 1869, covered an acre with its departments for the insane, nervous diseases, and inebriates. The third was in Oshkosh, Wisconsin and built in 1880. The fourth was built in Elizabeth, New Jersey, on land given for that purpose by Right Rev. Bishop Wigger. Competent surgeons and physicians attended to the patients, and the Brothers nursed and did the housework of the hospitals."|I agree with tom as it has the information regarding the topic and is a wikipedia page|3

31659778|77|cell phones|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Zone_(cellphone)|1|"A mobile phone signal (also known as reception and service) is the signal strength (measured in dBm) received by a mobile phone from a cellular network (on the downlink). Depending on various factors, such as proximity to a tower, any obstructions such as buildings or trees, etc., this signal strength will vary. Most mobile devices use a set of bars of increasing height to display the approximate strength of this received signal to the mobile phone user. Traditionally five bars are used; see five by five.

Generally, a strong mobile phone signal is more likely in an urban area, though these areas can also have some ""dead zones"" where no reception can be obtained. Cellular signals are designed to be resistant to multipath reception, which is most likely to be caused by the blocking of a direct signal path by large buildings such as high-rise towers. By contrast, many rural or sparsely inhabited areas lack any signal or have very weak fringe reception; many mobile phone providers are attempting to set up towers in those areas most likely to be occupied by users, such as along major highways. Even some national parks and other popular tourist destinations away from urban areas now have cell phone reception, though location of radio towers within these areas is normally prohibited or strictly regulated, and is often difficult to arrange."|The webpage doesn't satisfy the search query.|1

Although many coaches refuse to work with an athlete without the physiologic training information it provides, HRMs have their detractors. And that small backlash is slowly growing. An alternative to a HRM, not quite as technical and rigid, uses perceived effort as a measure of your level of exertion.|"The result is a lower heart rate for any level of physical activity in the trained versus the untrained individual. Thus aerobic training benefits include:

a lower resting heart rate
a lower heart rate for a specific level of exertion
an increased exercise capacity at an individual's maximum heart rate."|3

15353531|68|diversity|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_(politics)|2|"In sociology and political studies, the term diversity (or diverse) is used to describe political entities (neighborhoods, student bodies, etc.) with members who have identifiable differences in their cultural backgrounds or lifestyles.

The term describes differences in racial or ethnic classifications, age, gender, religion, philosophy, physical abilities, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, gender identity, intelligence, mental health, physical health, genetic attributes, behavior, attractiveness, or other identifying features.

In measuring human diversity, a diversity index measures the probability that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different ethnicities. If all residents are of the same ethnic group it's zero. The diversity index does not take into account the willingness of individuals to cooperate with those of other ethnicities. If half are from one group and half from another it's .50.[1]"|Yes has relevance to cultural diversity|2
