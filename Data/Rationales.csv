71498714|202|french lick resort and casino|http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PressReleases/FrancineSilvermanEleganceReturning_Oct1997.html|"We do know that the name French Lick originated in the 1700s when French fur traders observed livestock licking the mineral deposits found at the springs. Later on, American settlers built a fort in this ""Valley of the Seven Springs."" In 1845, physician William Bowles purchased the site and three mineral springs from the state of Indiana for $1.25 an acre. Eight years later, he opened the hotel and began selling ""Pluto"" water across the nation. (Two statues of these mythical gods of the lower world once guarded the springs from atop the old hotel entrance, but are now indoors).

The first French Lick hotel, a three-story frame structure, was destroyed by fire in 1897. In 1901, Tom J. Taggart, the former mayor of Indianapolis and Democratic boss, purchased the site. The West Baden Hotel had just burned to the ground and he didn't want to lose potential spa business. The present hotel, on 2600 acres, is an expanded and renovated version of Taggart's hotel.

Says Mills: ""During the Taggart years, the furnishings were replaced quite frequently. Taggart always had a very modern hotel."" The kitchen was self-sustaining, providing its own home-grown vegetables and milk products. A 1929 Christmas menu features barbequed opossum with southern candied yams and ice cream. (Tomato juice was first served and bottled in French Lick in 1917. A smokestack is all that's left of the factory)."|2

Most, but not all, countries require appraisers to be Licensed or Certified. Appraisers are often known as ""property valuers"" or ""land valuers""; in British English they are ""valuation surveyors"". If the appraiser's opinion is based on market value, then it must also be based on the highest and best use of the real property. In the United States, mortgage valuations of improved residential properties are generally reported on a standardized form like the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report.[1] Appraisals of more commercial properties (e.g., income-producing, raw land) are often reported in narrative format and competed by a Certified General Appraiser."|3

The theory is that the value of a property can be estimated by summing the land value and the depreciated value of any improvements.

Fragmentary leg bones and vertebrae of even larger dinosaur species are known, but these skeletal remains are too incomplete to determine their exact size. Several of these (Argentinasaurus and Amphicoelias) might have been one and a half to two times larger than Brachiosaurus.

Scientists have debated the origins of birds for many years and the most widely accepted theory is that they evolved from meat-eating dinosaurs.  The debate over the relationship between Aves (birds) and Theropod dinosaurs (meat-eaters) is actually quite old, the first discussion papers on this subject were published in Victorian times.  John Ostrom, the distinguished professor of vertebrate palaeontology at Yale University’s Peabody Museum of Natural History, published a number of papers analysing the evolution of flight.

For over 150 years, since scientific research began on dinosaurs in the early 1800s, dinosaurs were generally believed to be related to the reptile family; the word ""dinosaur"", coined in 1842 by paleontologist Richard Owen, comes from the Greek for ""terrible lizard"". This view began to shift during the so-called dinosaur renaissance in scientific research in the late 1960s, and by the mid-1990s significant evidence had emerged that dinosaurs are much more closely related to birds. In fact, birds are now believed to have descended directly from the theropod group of dinosaurs,[1] and are thus classified as dinosaurs themselves, meaning that any modern bird can be considered a feathered dinosaur, since all modern birds possess feathers (with the exception of a few artificially selected chickens).[2]"|3

The vast majority of feather discoveries have been for coelurosaurian theropods. However, integument has also been discovered on at least three ornithischians, raising the likelihood that proto-feathers were also present in earlier dinosaurs, and perhaps even a more ancestral animal, in light of the pycnofibers of pterosaurs. Crocodilians also possess beta keratin very similar to those of birds, which suggests that they evolved from a common ancestral gene.[3]|3

It originally came into use as a paradigm taught to pastors and other Christian leaders. This teaching is embodied in Warren's best-selling book, The Purpose Driven Church, first published in 1995.[1]

The basic premise of the Purpose Driven paradigm is for a pastor to recognize and be obedient to God's purposes for his people and his church and organize around developing these characteristics into the lives of people within his care. In Christian terms, this is the task of ""making disciples"". An additional focus is how to be most effective in reaching out to share God's love and forgiveness in the local community and with non-believers who visit the church. In Christian terms, this is the task of ""evangelism"". To be ""purpose driven"" is to be driven by God's purposes, not our own.[1]"|0

90350533|126|rick warren|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpose_Driven_Network|"Richard Duane ""Rick"" Warren (born January 28, 1954) is an American evangelical Christian pastor and author.[1][2][3] He is the founder and senior pastor of Saddleback Church, an evangelical megachurch in Lake Forest, California, that is the eighth-largest church in the United States (including multi-site churches).[4] He is also a bestselling author of many Christian books, including his guide to church ministry and evangelism, The Purpose Driven Church, which has spawned a series of conferences on Christian ministry and evangelism. He is perhaps best known for the subsequent book The Purpose Driven Life which has sold more than 30 million copies, making Warren a New York Times bestselling author.[5][6]"|1
11866879|466|rick warren|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpose_Driven_Network|The trademarked term purpose driven comes from the teaching of Rick Warren, senior pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California.

It originally came into use as a paradigm taught to pastors and other Christian leaders. This teaching is embodied in Warren's best-selling book, The Purpose Driven Church, first published in 1995.[1]

The basic premise of the Purpose Driven paradigm is for a pastor to recognize and be obedient to God's purposes for his people and his church and organize around developing these characteristics into the lives of people within his care. In Christian terms, this is the task of ""making disciples"". An additional focus is how to be most effective in reaching out to share God's love and forgiveness in the local community and with non-believers who visit the church. In Christian terms, this is the task of ""evangelism"". To be ""purpose driven"" is to be driven by God's purposes, not our own.[1]

These purposes, according to Warren's teaching, are found in two verses in the New Testament book of Matthew. These two passages, located in Matthew chapters 22 and 28, are often referred to by Christians worldwide as ""the Great Commandment"" and ""the Great Commission."" From these verses, Warren identified five purposes: worship, ministry, mission, fellowship, and discipleship.[1]"|1

In measuring human diversity, a diversity index measures the probability that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different ethnicities. If all residents are of the same ethnic group it's zero. The diversity index does not take into account the willingness of individuals to cooperate with those of other ethnicities.

In the current period however, there appears to be a greater concern with issues related to diversity and difference than there did in earlier sociological approaches. Among the types of terms, language, and approaches taken in contemporary sociology are:

Diversity – ethnic and cultural.
Difference and inequality.
Difference troubles (Seidman).

Individuality and individual choice.

Since HRmax varies by individual, the most accurate way of measuring any single person's HRmax is via a cardiac stress test. In this test, a person is subjected to controlled physiologic stress (generally by treadmill) while being monitored by an ECG. The intensity of exercise is periodically increased until certain changes in heart function are detected on the ECG monitor, at which point the subject is directed to stop. Typical duration of the test ranges ten to twenty minutes.

Adults who are beginning a new exercise regimen are often advised to perform this test only in the presence of medical staff due to risks associated with high heart rates. For general purposes, a formula is often employed to estimate a person's maximum heart rate. However, these predictive formulas have been criticized as inaccurate because they generalized population-averages and usually focus on a person's age. It is well-established that there is a ""poor relationship between maximal heart rate and age"" and large standard deviations relative to predicted heart rates.[13] (see Limitations of Estimation Formulas).

Given as monotherapy (with short-acting nitrates allowed as required), ivabradine has demonstrated anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal efficacy in randomized trials in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris when compared with placebo11 and has been shown to be non-inferior to atenolol12 or amlodipine.13 The drug has been recommended for the medical management of patients with stable angina pectoris who are intolerant of beta-blockers or in whom these agents are contraindicated.6|2
94611377|109|lower heart rate|http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ehn571|Angina pectoris is typically caused by myocardial ischaemia owing to an imbalance between myocardial perfusion and oxygen demand. Elevated heart rate increases myocardial oxygen demand and limits tissue perfusion, the latter by reducing the duration of diastole during which most myocardial perfusion occurs. Long-term prognosis in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris is favourable1 and medical and interventional therapies show similar benefit.2,3 Thus, current treatment guidelines advocate an initial approach with medical therapy.4–6 Beta-blockers reduce myocardial ischaemia and prevent angina pectoris largely by lowering heart rate and are recommended as an initial therapy for stable angina pectoris, unless contraindicated.6–8|2

It is usually equal or close to the pulse measured at any peripheral point. Activities that can provoke change include physical exercise, sleep, anxiety, stress, illness, and ingestion of drugs.

The normal resting adult human heart rate ranges from 60–100 bpm.[1] Tachycardia is a fast heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest.[2] Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest. During sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around 40–50 bpm is common and is considered normal. When the heart is not beating in a regular pattern, this is referred to as an arrhythmia. Abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease.[3]"|2

When you contract your leg muscles during exercise, muscles squeeze veins near them to pump blood toward the heart. Then when leg muscles relax, the veins fill up with blood. The pumping action of leg muscles during exercise forces extra blood to the heart, which causes the heat to beat faster and contract stronger.|3

The basal or resting heart rate (HRrest) is defined as the heart rate when a person is awake, in a neutrally temperate environment, and has not been subject to any recent exertion or stimulation, such as stress or surprise. The typical resting heart rate in adults is 60–100 beats per minute (bpm). This is the firing rate of the heart's sinoatrial node, where the faster pacemaker cells driving the self-generated rhythmic firing and responsible for the heart's autorhythmicity are located.[9] For endurance athletes at the elite level, it is not unusual to have a resting heart rate between 33 and 50 bpm"|2

This theoretical range varies based mostly on age; however, a person's physical condition, sex, and previous training also are used in the calculation. Below are two ways to calculate one's THR. In each of these methods, there is an element called ""intensity"" which is expressed as a percentage. The THR can be calculated as a range of 65–85% intensity. However, it is crucial to derive an accurate HRmax to ensure these calculations are meaningful.[citation needed]
